------------------------------- THE GAME -------------------------------
4 players (Human or CPUs) take turns going around a board.
The goal is to have the most gold at the end.
You get gold from different sources: random events, fighting monsters,
fighting other players (you take half of the gold of defeated opponents)
or simply completing a lap around the board.

While keeping gold is important as it is your final score, it can be
used during the game to upgrade your gear and your stats to help you
fight better.
